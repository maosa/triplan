Here is the prompt I wrote:

"I want to build a web app for planning and tracking my triathlon training. This will be mainly used to plan and track workouts for a specific race, not to routinely plan and track all workouts. This is because I want the app to diligently plan and track race-specific workouts. When I'm not training for a race, I'm much more flexible with planning / tracking, so I don't need the app for that.

At first, I will be the only user, but let's account for functionality to have multiple users. Users should be able to sign up / create their account (by defining their first name, last name, email address, username, and password), and only have access and edit capabilities to their own data. The app is for personal use, not social interactions.

The app should have the following hierarchy: User > Race > Training Plan > Individual Workout > Workout-Specific Details.

I envision a modern, minimal, and simple interface. Users log in and immediately land on the Home / Race page - a page showing them a list of their tracked races, and a plus button to add more races. If no races have been previously inputted by users, they should only see the plus button, and perhaps a text message saying something like "No races tracked".

Clicking the plus button to add a new race should open up a modal allowing the user to capture race-specific information: Name (free text), Location (free text), Date (date picker), and Details (free text). These pieces of information, except for Details, should be displayed on the Race page - It's ok to have smaller font size on mobile screens to make sure the info fits. For newly added races, the modal should have buttons to Save, and Cancel. When clicking on existing races, users should be able to edit race details through the modal, but this modal should have buttons to Save, Cancel, and Delete a race. Deleting a race would also delete all associated workouts, so if a user clicks on Delete, there should be a confirmation message warning them about this, and asking them if they are sure they want to delete the race and all associated workouts.

Once a race has been created, users should be able to click on that, and navigate to the Training Plan page. This is where users will be able to plan and track their workouts. There should be a plus button to allow users to create new workouts in a list or table format. If the page is empty (i.e., there are no tracked workouts) have a message saying something like "No workouts tracked". Clicking the plus button to add a new workout should open up a modal allowing the user to capture workout-specific information: Date (date picker - this should have the current date selected by default), Type (single-select dropdown: Swim, Bike, Run, Strength, Rest, Stretching,  Other), Duration (duration / time picker allowing users to set hours and minutes; it should allow up to 99 hours, and 59 minutes), Distance (numeric value; let's have km as the units), Intensity (single-select dropdown of numeric values from 0-10, in intervals of 0.5), and Details (free text). If a user selects a workout type = "Rest", automatically set the intensity to 0, with no option to edit it.

Note, the Date field should not allow users to enter a date that is after the date of the race associated with this workout - either have the date picker be greyed out after the race date, or have an error message show up when trying to save a workout with a workout date that's after the associated race date.

On the Training Plan page users should be able to see only the key information for a workout, such as Date (in short format, like MMM, DD-JJJ-YY), Type - show this using relevant icons for each sport (i.e., Swim = blue swimming icon with the swimmer facing to the right, Bike = a green bicycle icon, Run = an orange runner facing right,  Strength = a deep red dumbbell icon, Rest = a purple icon with the sleeping "zzz", Stretching = a beige-coloured yoga mat icon, Other = a grey square with rounded edges), Duration (format as HH:MM), Distance, and Intensity. Intensity values should be colour-coded from green (0) to red (10) to visually indicate workout intensity. Use pastel colours throughout to keep it easy on the eyes. I usually track bike and strength workouts using Duration, not time; and swim and run workouts using Distance, not Duration. So if only one of the two data points is available for a workout, just show that value and leave the other blank / greyed out.

Also, note, I should be able to add multiple workouts per day. The way to do this would be the same as described above, but all workouts would have the same date. It's ok to have two consecutive workouts show on the Training Plan page with the same date as MMM, DD-JJJ-YY. However, you may have to think about adding a unique race and workout ID to each entry, that's not visible anywhere, but just for data tracking.

For newly added workouts, the modal should have buttons to Save, and Cancel. When clicking on existing workouts, users should be able to edit workout details through the modal, but this modal should have buttons to Save, Cancel, Duplicate, and Delete a workout. Deleting a workout should have a confirmation popup asking users if they are sure they want to delete the workout. Duplicate should allow users to duplicate a workout; with the duplicated workout having all the same details as the original one, but the date is automatically updated to the current date. For example, on Fri, 6-Feb-2026, a user duplicates a workout with a date of Wed, 4-Feb-2026; that duplicated has the same details as the original one, but is automatically dated as Fri, 6-Feb-2026. This is saved in the appropriate place in the Training Plan page, and is a normal, editable workout like all others. This should make it easy to duplicate workouts that are done regularly.

The two main pages are the Race page and the Training Plan page. So let's include somewhere (ideally top left) a home button to be able to from the Training Plan page to the Race page. On all pages, let's also have a button to switch between dark and light mode - dark mode should be the default.

I need the app to work both on laptop and smartphone screens. Although I would like to first test it locally, it will be hosted on a free hosting platform like Netlify (I already have an account), and integrate with any other necessary platforms."

Please refine this to be optimised for an AI-based vibe or agentic coding tool / platform. Also, add at the end of the prompt, the recommended technical requirements and recommendations from above (I have a Supabase account so let me know what information is required from that). It'd be great to go into details about what font type, and icons to use etc. Anything you can think of to make this an amazing, functional, modern, simple, and minimal app for planning and tracking triathlon training plans.

#####

I thought of a few other stuff to add. So please refine the plan to include these. Since this will at some point be an app used by multiple users, I would like to have the following:

* Let's have the races listed on Race page, and the workouts listed on the Training Plan page, be a stacked list

* Let's remove the need for users to set a username when signing up - first name, last name, email address, and password are sufficient

* When you visit the site, there is a simple log in page, asking you to log in with your email and password. Include some other standard options such as "Forgot your password?" and "Don't have an account? Sign up."

* Users should have their on account / profile page. There, they should have the ability to change their email, or password, log out, as well as delete their account. When deleting their account, there needs to be a confirmation pop-up asking them to confirm this means all of their data will be lost. Account / profile pages should also allow users to set their units (metric vs. imperial) - this change should be reflected in the workout distance, based on what users defined in their profile page - basically allowing switching between kilometers (km) and miles (mi). Also, the theme toggle should be removed from where we currently have it, and place it in the user profile / account page, where they can set their account to be in dark or light mode (dark should remain the default)

* Users should be able to download their data, or upload data, from their profile / account page. Both these functionalities should only be available when accessing the app from a laptop web browser, not a mobile. Download means downloading a single CSV file include all user's workout data, with columns being Race Name, Race Location, Race Date, Race Details, Workout Date, Workout Type, Workout Duration, Workout Distance, Workout Intensity , and Workout Details - it's ok to have blanks where info is missing. Similarly, uploading means being able to upload a single CSV file with the same columns. For uploading, there should be an error message and prevent upload, if the Race Name and Race Date already exists in the platform - this is to prevent uploading duplicate data for a specific race

* The user profile / account page should only be accessible from the home page, which is the Race page

* Let's and the prompt with a question to the AI-based vibe / agentic coding platform, asking if it needs any additional information or clarifications

#####

Awesome - thanks! A couple more additions please:
* On the log in page, have a "Remember me" option. This improves user convenience by storing a persistent cookie or username in the browser, allowing users to avoid re-entering credentials for future visits. It keeps users logged in even after closing the browser or session
* At the very end, let's make it clear for the agent to not write any code before we confirm the final questions

#####

Super - thanks! One final change, promise the final one. I previously said this app would be hosted on Netlify, but I changed my mind! I will try using Vercel for this one

#####

Your super-prompt worked! I pasted it into Antigravity and Gemini 3 Pro did a fantastic job at building the app and explaining how to deploy it! I have some feedback from my initial platform use; please help me refine this so I can pass it on to the agentic AI developer:

* In the sign in page, the Email input field has "m@example.com" as placeholder text. Let's change this to "Please enter your email"

* When a user signs up, they see the following green text "Please checks your email to confirm your account.". Let's correct the grammar on this to be "Please check your email to confirm your account"

* In Account Settings, let's have a green message appear when users click on Save Preferences, to say something like "Your preferences have been saved"

* In Account Settings, changing Theme from Dark to Light, and saving that change, does not change the app theme. Let's make sure we define appropriate colours for the Light theme, and have this functionality work as it should i.e., once a user saves a new theme preference, the app should change to that theme

* In the Add Race and Add Workout modals, the calendar icon for the Date field is dark coloured, and hence very hard to see with the dark theme. Let's have this is as white so it's visible with the dark theme. We can keep as it is for the light theme

* In the Add Workout modal, let's have the text placeholder in Duration (HH:MM) be 00:00

* In the Training Plan page, I want to change the way the date is displayed within each element in the stacked list. Currently it's as "DDD, MMM DD", but this does not account for the year, which makes it weird when tracking workouts over a period where the year changes (e.g., October 2025 - February 2026). Let's change the date format to be "DDD, DD MMM YYYY"

* When a user selects workout type = Rest, let's block the Duration and Distance fields so they cannot edit them

* In the Training Plan page, I noticed the following after adding a few workouts. The duration, distance, and intensity values shown within individual workouts in the stacked list, are not aligned vertically across workouts. For example, having an intensity of 6.5 instead of 6, throws things out of alignment. Perhaps we could have each of these values occupy their own space, and be sufficiently wide such that any possible value entered wouldn't cause any misalignment. For Duration we should accommodate sufficient width for 99:59, for Distance sufficient width for 999.9km, and for Intensity sufficient width for 10.0. Also, Duration, Distance, or Intensity might be missing for a specific workout, but this doesn't mean the fields that we have info for should all squeeze to the left; each one should have a fixed position across all elements of the stacked list, to ensure all values are aligned vertically within their own field type (i.e., Duration, Distance, or Intensity)

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer:

* In Account Settings, I noticed when I make a change to the Units or Theme dropdown, and save those changes, I get the confirmation message, the changes are applied, but the dropdown field I changed still shows the old value. Only when I refresh the page the dropdown shows the newly selected value. Let's make sure any changes to these fields are reflected in the value shown in the dropdown once a user saves the change

* In Add Workout, the dropdown for the workout type is in a different colour to the rest of the app. Let's make sure this is aligned to the rest of the app appropriately, depending on whether the user is in dark or light mode

* The icons for each type of workout should be as: Swim = as it currently is; Bike = same icon, but coloured in green; Run = change from an emoji to an icon that matches the style / format of the icons we have for the other workout types, and colour it in the orange we currently have the bike icon coloured in; Strength = as it currently is; Rest = as it currently is; Stretching = as it currently is; Other = activity icon, same colour as we currently have Stretching coloured in

* Let's remove Stretching from the workout type	dropdown; Swim, Bike, Run, Strength, Rest, and Other are sufficient

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer:

* In the Training Plan page, I want to have workouts sorted by their Date in descending order, so I can see the latest ones first

* The app allows users to have multiple workouts within the same day. This may create some ambiguity as to how to sort workouts that have the same date in the Training Plan page. I would like to have workouts with the same date, sorted in the list (within that date) based on when a workout was edited (can potentially use the database timestamp). Obviously, for workouts across different dates, let's keep the sorting as described above (i.e., sorted by the Date, in descending order)

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer:

* For a non-empty Training Plan page, it would be great if, when users navigate to that Training Plan page, the list of workouts is centred such that workouts with the current date are in the middle of the screen - that way users can focus on the current date's workouts, but also see a few of their previous and upcoming workouts. If the list only has workouts up until the current date, then users will be able to see the current date's workout(s) at the top of the list, and a few of the previous workouts below. Obviously for an empty Training Plan page we don't change anything

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer:

* The functionality just implemented to automatically scroll the workout list so that workouts with the current date are positioned approximately in the vertical middle of the viewport, works as it should. However, I only want this behaviour to work when a user navigates to the Training Plan page from the Races page - not in any other circumstance. At the moment, this auto scrolling behaviour also works after adding a new workout. This results in the following problem: If a user adds a new workout at a date that is far from the current date (perhaps in this case the current date's workouts may not even be visible in the viewport), then instead of the user staying at the top of the workouts list and being able to see that new workout, the app auto scrolls to the workouts of the current date. Then is the user wants to add another workout, they have to scroll back up

* Let's carefully re-visit the following. Very good progress has been made, but let's make sure we nail it!

Issue:

When a user changes Units or Theme and clicks Save Preferences:
The change is correctly saved
The confirmation message appears and the app behaviour updates
BUT the dropdown reverts back to original value for a few seconds
Then it suddenly snaps to the new value, right at the same time the confirmation message disappears

Required fix: 

Ensure that after a successful save:
The dropdown value for Units and Theme immediately reflects the newly selected value; without changing back to the original value or waiting for the confirmation message to disappears
The UI state is fully in sync with persisted user preferences
A page refresh should not be required for the dropdown to update

* Let's have the Account and Log Out buttons / options be also visible and functional in the Training Plan page

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer:

* Most buttons are not visible in  Light mode - all except those that are in red (i.e., those that have to do with deleting stuff). Let's make sure all buttons and any text within them, are coloured appropriately in Light mode. Dark mode looks and works as it should

* When navigating to the Training Plan page, the brand name (i.e., TriPlan) disappears from the top left. It would be great to keep that where it is in the Race page. In the Training Plan page, we can shift the Back to Races a bit to the right, but make sure it's left aligned with the race name, race date, Workouts title, and stacked list

* In the Race and Training Plan pages, let's make sure the Log Out button is right aligned with the other elements on each respective page, and keep Account next to it (on the left), at a distance similar to the one it's at now

* It would be really cool if we could have a live countdown on each Race tile in Race page. This should say something like "XX days left", with the calculation being Race Date - Current Date. For the purpose of this app (i.e., triathlon race planning), I'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's best to include the end date / Race Date in the calculation or not. 1 day before the race day is would say "1 day left". On Race day it should say "Time to race". And the day after the race it should disappear from the race tile

* The arrow on all dropdowns feels too close to the right side of the dropdown box. Can we add just a bit of space so it moves slightly to the left?

* When hovering over the Back to Races button in the Training Plan page, the arrow and text within the button do not feel centered. Let's make sure there is equal spacing from the left button side to the arrow icon, and the right button side to the end of the text

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer:

* In the Training Plan page, the Back to Races button should stay where it is horizontally, and its looks and functionality stay unchanged, but be placed in the page header so it's accessible even when scrolling through the workout list

* The Log Out button should remain in the header, but be right aligned with the right edge of the Add Workout button and the right edge of the  workout list elements

* The Account button should remain in the header, and should sit immediately to the left of Log Out, at a distance similar to the one it's currently at

* Let's make sure TriPlan appears consistently in the header of all pages

* Carefully check all dropdows! The dropdown arrow appears too close to the right edge of the dropdown box. Add a small amount of right padding so the arrow shifts slightly left. Across both Dark and Light themes, ensure visual balance, consistency across all dropdowns, and no impact on click/tap usability

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer:

* No need for the header to occupy two rows. Let's have the "Back to Races" button on the same row as the TriPlan brand and Account / Log Out actions, positioned left, and aligned with main content

* Let's make sure the Back to Races button in the Account page, looks and is positioned, in the same way as it is in the Training Plan page

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer:

* The Log Out button is correctly found in the header, and present across pages. However, this should be move further right, and have its right side aligned with the right edge of the Add Workout button and the right edge of the workout list elements

* The Account button is correctly found in the header, and present across pages. After correctly positioning the Log Out button, the Account button should remain in the header, and should sit immediately to the left of Log Out, at a distance similar to the one it's currently at

* The position of the Log Out and Account buttons should be set as above, and remain the same across pages

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer:

* It seems the drop-down are not updating as expected. The dropdown arrow / chevron appears too close to the right edge of the dropdown box. Add a bit more right padding so the arrow moves slightly to the left. Across both Dark and Light themes, ensure visual balance, and consistency across all dropdowns, and no impact on usability

#####

According to Supabase, the app if facing the following performance issue:

Tables have a row level security policy for users to view, update, insert, and delete, that re-evaluates current_setting() or auth.<function>() for each row. This produces suboptimal query performance at scale. Resolve the issue by replacing auth.<function>() with (select auth.<function>()).

How and where should this change be implemented?

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a very clear single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer:

You need to take a very close and careful look at this. I keep asking for the same thing, and I do not see any changes. The Log Out, Account, and Back to Races buttons have not moved at all. Also, Back to Races now has more space on the left side, between the arrow icon and the left button border, than it has on the right side, between the end of the text, and the right button border. Let's make we fix Back to Races so spacing is equal on both sides. Most importantly, we need to make sure Log Out, and Account are aligned as described! The Log Out button should be right-aligned to the right border of the Add Workout button, which is the same as being right-aligned to the right border of the stacked workout list

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback specific to how the app looks on a smartphone screen. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer:

* On the log in screen, when clicking on the email or password fields to fill in the details, the screen zooms in on those, causing other elements to be cut off from view, and requiring the user to zoom back out to view the full app

* The text in Import CSV reads differently to the one on laptop screen. On mobile it's "no file selected" and on laptop it's "No file chosen". Let's make sure this message is "No file chosen" across both

* The Race tile cannot be edited. On laptop, hovering over it causes an edit icon to appear on the top right corner, and clicking it allows editing of Race information. Users cannot hover on a smartphone touchscreen so we need to have the edit icon visible at all times when using a smartphone

* The date input fields appear wider and taller than the other input fields. This doesn't look nice, and sometimes it causes them to clash with other input fields / overflow. Let's make sure date input fields are the same size as all other input fields. If the problem is cause by the calendar icon, let's make that smaller or remove it altogether when accessing the app through a smartphone

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer:

* In the Add Workout modal, let's make sure the race intensity slider displays values with 1 decimal place. So whole numbers will appear with a ".0" and half steps with a ".5"

* "Log Out" is right-aligned flush with "Add Workout" only when the screen / window is made very narrow. I need this alignment to also hold true when using the app on a wide screen

* This is a very important issue that still persists! When accessing the app through a smartphone, the date input fields appear bigger than the other input fields. This doesn't look nice, and sometimes it causes them to clash with other input fields / overflow. Let's make sure date input fields are the same size as all other input fields. If the problem is caused by the calendar icon, let's reduce it's padding and make that smaller,  or remove it altogether when accessing the app through a smartphone

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer. Do not include emojis / icons in your response:

* Update the README.md file to provide a short overview / description of the platform. Feel free to humorously mention the app is vibe-coded, and take a promotional / marketing-like approach

* I like where the TriPlan logo is current positioned, but it moves around slightly across pages. Let's make sure it's position exactly the same across pages

* On smartphone, in the Add workout modal, the font size of the workout type field looks smaller compared to the text of the other input fields in the modal. Let's make sure the text in all input fiends within the modal have the same font size

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer. Do not include emojis / icons in your response:

* Edit the README.me file to remove the Getting Started section - I don't want them cloning the repository and installing the app locally. I want them to use my version of the app hosted on Vercel. So, remove the Getting Started section, and have the app link (https://triathlonplan.vercel.app/) visible / hyperlinked somewhere at the top so it's easy to spot. Also, at the end of the file add something short on another app I've built, TriCalc; this is basically an app for calculating your triathlon race time. The GitHub repository is at https://github.com/maosa/tricalc, and the app at https://triathloncalc.netlify.app/ - include hyperlinks for both the GitHub repository and the app URL, so anyone reading this can visit and explore

* When accessing the app on a smartphone, in the Workouts page, the information in the workouts list is not visible. The workout type icons are ok, but the date, and workout details are not visible (see attached image). I'm happy to use a slightly smaller font size, as well as narrower spacing between duration, distance and intensity

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer. At the end, generate, a short git commit message and description, both as text, not code. Do not include emojis / icons in your response.

* The TriCalc logo still seems to jump around a bit when navigating between the Races and Training Plan pages. I noticed the header element dimensions is 1365 x 65 in the Races page, but  1350 x 65 in the Training Plan and Account pages. This might be the issue. Let's make sure the header has the same dimensions across pages, and is aligned with the widest divs inside the main element

* When accessing the app on a smartphone, the workout-specific information in the workouts list is still quite squeezed and certain elements overflow / clash with others. We can reduce the horizontal spacing between those elements, have the distance units closer to the distance value, and have the coloured intensity dot closer to the intensity value. Let's make sure we can fit duration values as large as HH:MM, and distance values as large as ###.# km. If needed, I'm happy with slightly smaller icon sizes, font sizes, and element padding

#####

* The TriPlan logo still jumps around when navigating between the Races and Training Plan pages, as well as between the Account and Training Plan pages. No jumping between the Training Plan and Account pages. This may be because of the <div class="flex items-center gap-4"> that hold the TriPlan logo. In the Races pages, this div contains just the logo, whereas in the other pages it also contains the Back to Races button. This may be the root of the logo jumping around. Make sure the TriPlan logo stays in exactly the same position throught all pages

* I see no change in the smartphone view. Information in the workout list remains squeezed and certain elements overflow / clash with others. Make sure changes have been properly implemented

#####

* When accessing the app through a smartphone, information in the workout list remains squeezed and certain elements overflow / clash with others. Specifically, the distance units clash with the coloured intensity dot. To improve the overall design, and make sure the smartphone view looks as it should, we could implement the following changes:
- Instead of a coloured dot, we could have the intensity value in a colour-filled rectangular shape with rounded corners, similar to that used for workout duration. Let's make sure the intensity colour palette is such that having the intensity value inside the shape in font colour black, ensures it's clearly visible across all intensity colours
- Slightly less spacing between workout duration, distance, and intensity to ensure these elements don't clash with each other

* Let's move the entire Data Management section (exporting / importing data) into the Account page, between Preferences and Security. Make sure the format of the Data Management section matches that of the other sections within the Account page

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer. At the end, generate, a short git commit message and description, both as text, not code. Do not include emojis / icons in your response.

* In the Account page, let's have the Data Management section look like the Preferences and Security sections. That is, have the title "Data Management" outside <div class="rounded-lg border border-border bg-card p-6">, and the export and import functionalities inside the div

* In the workout list, let's make sure the badge for workout duration, and the badge for workout intensity, are the exactly the same shape and size. One needs to be able to accommodate HH:MM, and the other 10.0, respectively. Let's make sure this still holds true even after the two badges are the same size and shape

* In the workout list, let's make sure the font size for workout duration, workout distance, and workout intensity is the same across all three values

#####

Thanks! I have some additional feedback. Please help me refine this, and have it as a single prompt that I can pass on to the agentic AI developer. At the end, generate, a short git commit message and description, both as text, not code. Do not include emojis / icons in your response.

* In the Account page, in the Data Management section, let's make sure the system interprets dates in the CSV files using the European/International format (DD/MM/YYYY)

* In the Account page, in the Data Management section, let's make sure the Export and Import functions look consistent:

- Let's make sure the Export CSV button looks exactly the same in terms of style and size to the Import button, and the two are exactly horizontally aligned. Trim the text inside the button to just say "Export"

- Similar to the div containing the text "No file chosen" that allows users to select a file to upload, let's have a div of the same size and horizontally aligned, that is just text (no border) saying something like "Export your data as a single CSV file". This should be on the left of the Export CSV button. Above this, there should be a label (similar to the one saying "Import CSV") saying "Export CSV"

- The goal is to ensure as much visual consistency between the Export and Import functions

#####
